Gig Mileage Tracker – Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 11/29/2025

Gig Mileage Tracker ("the App") is developed to help users track and manage mileage for gig work, deliveries, rideshare driving, and business-related travel. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data.
By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
1. Information We Collect
The App may collect and process the following information:
A. Location Data
Used to detect movement, record mileage, plot trip distances, and generate mileage logs.
Collected only when trip tracking is enabled or active in the background (if user grants permission).
You may enable, restrict, or revoke access at any time through device settings.
B. Trip & Mileage Data
Start/end location, total distance, trip duration, and user-selected categories or gig services.
Stored locally on your device and optionally synced/exported by your choice.
C. Export, Reports, & Email Data
The App allows you to export mileage reports to CSV, XLSX, PDF, or email.
No report is transmitted unless you choose to send/share it.
We never automatically send trip data to external servers.
D. Subscription & Billing Information
Subscription purchases are handled through Apple App Store (In-App Purchase).
We do not collect or store credit card or payment data — Apple manages billing securely.
E. Optional User Information
If you choose to contact support, we may collect your email address only for assistance.
We do not request personal identity details unless needed to troubleshoot issues.
2. How Data Is Used
We use collected information solely to operate core features of the App:
To track mileage and produce trip logs
To generate reports for tax/financial documentation
To support filters, categories, and gig-service defaults
To export files per user request
To improve app performance and reliability
We do not sell or share your data with third parties.
3. Data Storage & Retention
Trip and mileage records are stored locally on your device.
You maintain full control and may delete your data anytime.
If you export or email reports, copies may exist wherever you save or send them.
We do not store personal data on external servers unless explicitly implemented later (and this policy will update accordingly).
4. User Control & Choices
You may:
Enable/disable location permissions at any time
Delete trip entries or reset app data
Export records for personal storage
Choose not to create or share reports
Cancel your subscription through Apple at any time
Your data belongs to you.
5. Third-Party Services
The App may use the following external services:
Apple App Store billing (In-App Purchases)
Apple device frameworks for storage, permissions, and system integrations
No third-party analytics or advertising platforms are used unless disclosed later.
6. Children’s Privacy
The App is not intended for children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect data from children.
7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as features evolve. Changes will be posted within the App and/or via updated release notes. Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of updated terms.
